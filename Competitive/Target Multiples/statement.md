# Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `nums` and `target`.  
In a single operation, you may increment any element of `nums` by 1.

Return **the minimum number** of operations required so that each element in `target` has **at least** one multiple in `nums`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`
nums = [1, 2, 3], target = [4]
`

**Output:**
`
1
`

**Explanation:**  
Increment 3 to 4 with just one operation, making 4 a multiple of itself.


### Example 2:

**Input:**
`
nums = [8, 4], target = [10, 5]
`

**Output:**
`
2
`

**Explanation:**  
Increment 8 to 10 with 2 operations, making 10 a multiple of both 5 and 10.

### Example 3:

**Input:**
`
nums = [7, 9, 10], target = [7]
`

**Output:**
`
0
`

**Explanation:**  
Target 7 already has a multiple in `nums`, so no additional operations are needed. 

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10⁴`  
- `1 <= target.length <= 4`  
- `target.length <= nums.length`  
- `1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 10⁴`
