# Playground
This is a collection of my educational codes.

There you can find:
* some examples by reading books
* trying language features
* building simple echo servers, chats, etc.
* threading practicing
* household scripts
* solutions to leetcode problems
* architecture and patterns practice
* and other...

_Note_: this repo is also used for reference from my compendium (to avoid inlining large codes). You can find it on: [rayskiy7/compendium](https://rayskiy7.github.io/compendium)

## About navigation
There is no any general navigation page as no need. Each subdirectory of this repo contains its own readme file with a short description of the content. Feel free to explore!
